OBJECTIVE
Be the first player to reach 200 points across multiple rounds.

COMPONENTS (108 cards total)
Number Cards (81): 12×12, 11×11, 10×10... 2×2, 1×1, 1×0
Modifier Cards (15): +2 through +10 (add points), x2 (doubles number card total)
Action Cards (12): Freeze!, Flip Three!, Second Chance!

SETUP
1. Shuffle all 108 cards into a central draw pile.
2. Choose a dealer (rotates clockwise each round).
3. Track scores using paper or scoresheet.

DEALING
1. Dealer deals one card at a time to each player.
2. If an Action card is dealt, resolve it immediately before continuing.
3. Continue until everyone has at least one card.

PLAYER TURNS (starting left of dealer, clockwise)
Active players (not busted/stayed) choose:

HIT: Draw one card
- Number cards go in a row (count toward score and 7-unique goal)
- Modifier cards go above row (affect score only)
- Action cards resolve immediately
- BUST if you draw a duplicate number (score 0 for round)
- INSTANT WIN if you collect 7 unique numbers (round ends, +15 bonus)

STAY: End turn voluntarily, keep all cards and points (becomes inactive)

ACTION CARDS
Freeze! - Target active player immediately ends turn, keeps current score.

Flip Three! - Target active player draws 3 cards one at a time. Number/Modifier cards resolve normally. Action cards drawn are set aside (except Second Chance). Stop early if player busts or reaches 7 unique numbers.

Second Chance - Protects from one duplicate. When duplicate drawn, discard both cards and continue. Can only hold one at a time. If dealt a second, give to another active player without one (otherwise discard). All unused Second Chance cards discarded at round end.

ROUND END
Round ends when either:
1. A player collects 7 unique number cards, OR
2. All players have busted or stayed

SCORING
Busted: 0 points
Otherwise:
1. Sum all number cards
2. If x2 card: double the sum
3. Add all +X modifier cards
4. If 7 unique numbers: add 15-point bonus

GAME END
When any player reaches 200+ points, highest score(s) win(s).
