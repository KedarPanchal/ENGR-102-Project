Flip 7 is a press-your-luck card game.
Players compete to reach two hundred total points.
Points come from number cards accumulated each round.
Higher numbers appear more frequently within the deck.
Drawing a duplicate number causes an immediate bust.
Busting removes you from the round entirely.
You score nothing if you bust at any time.

If you flip seven unique number cards, you succeed.
That success ends the round instantly for everyone.
Achieving seven unique numbers grants fifteen bonus points.
Action and modifier cards never count toward the seven.

At the start, shuffle the full deck thoroughly.
Choose one player to act as the round’s dealer.
A pen and paper help track all running scores.
Printable score sheets and tools exist but are optional.

The dealer begins by giving each player one card.
All dealt cards are placed face up immediately.
If an action card appears while dealing, pause dealing.
Resolve the action card completely before dealing continues.
Some players may receive several cards while others don't.
Some may have no cards after the initial deal.

When dealing ends, players take turns in order.
Each player chooses to hit or stay on their turn.
Hitting gives you another card drawn face up.
Number cards sit in one row before the player.
Modifier cards are placed above the number row.
You may choose to stay only if you have cards.
Staying locks in your points and ends your involvement.
Stayed players become inactive until the round finishes.

A number card’s value contributes directly to scoring.
The deck contains twelve twelves and eleven elevens.
Counts continue downward until one single one exists.
There is also one zero worth no points.
Zero helps by increasing your chance to reach seven.

Modifier cards adjust points but cannot cause busts.
Plus cards add their printed value to your total.
Several values exist, such as plus two or plus ten.
The x2 card doubles all number card points combined.
After doubling, add any remaining modifier bonuses.
You may end a round without number cards present.
In that case, only modifier points apply unless x2.
A lone x2 card scores nothing by itself.

Action cards target any active player, including yourself.
An active player means someone not busted or stayed.
Action effects are placed above that player's number area.

Freeze immediately locks the player out of the round.
Their current total is instantly banked as final points.

Flip Three forces the player to draw three cards.
Draw them one at a time in normal sequence.
Stop drawing if the player reaches seven unique numbers.
Stop if the player busts by drawing a duplicate.
All number, modifier, and action cards count toward three.
Second Chance drawn during this process may be saved.
Additional Freeze or Flip Three resolve after all three draws.
They only resolve if the player has not busted already.

Second Chance protects against one duplicate number card.
If a duplicate appears, discard Second Chance and duplicate.
You may only keep one Second Chance at a time.
If you draw a second, give it to another active player.
If none are eligible, discard the second copy entirely.
All unused Second Chance cards discard at round’s end.

The round ends when all players become inactive.
Inactive means everyone has either busted or stayed.
A round also ends if any player flips seven uniques.

Scoring follows several clear steps at each round’s end.
First, add together all values of collected number cards.
If you have the x2 card, double the sum afterward.
Next, add all modifier bonuses printed on those cards.
Finally, add fifteen points if you reached seven uniques.

After scoring, move all used cards to a discard pile.
Do not shuffle these cards back into the deck yet.
Pass the remaining deck clockwise to the next dealer.
Continue rounds until the deck runs out naturally.
When necessary, shuffle the discard pile into a new deck.
Cards in front of players remain untouched during reshuffling.
This includes facedown piles from busted or stayed players.

The game ends when one or more players reach two hundred.
At that moment, the player with the highest score wins.
If tied, play an additional round to break the tie.
Players are encouraged to enjoy the luck-driven experience.
